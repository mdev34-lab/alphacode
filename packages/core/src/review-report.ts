 *
 * Delivery extracts this envelope from the complete child output instead of
 * trusting the last text part, which a trailing empty text part can erase.
 * When several complete envelopes appear, the last one is canonical by
 * protocol: duplicated structured output is tolerated rather than turned into
 * another delivery failure, and render() normalizes the persisted result back
 * to a single canonical envelope.
 *
 * Envelopes written before the product rename are still recognized, so reports
 * persisted by older sessions — and integrations that still build the old
 * literal — keep parsing instead of failing as missing. Only the canonical tag
 * is ever emitted or advertised.

 * exactly like a canonical one: the last complete envelope wins across tag
 * spellings, so mixed text cannot resolve to a different report than the one

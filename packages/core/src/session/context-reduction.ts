/**
 * Dynamic context reduction: the derivation of the context one provider request carries from the
 * session's canonical history.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * Canonical history is authoritative and is never modified. Reduction is a pure function of the
 * history and of the request being prepared for — the model's usable window, the prompt envelope
 * the request carries besides history, and the resolved policy — and it returns a *projection* of
 * that history: some of its messages, in their original order, where a few recorded tool payloads
 * have been replaced by smaller equivalents. It never invents a message, never rewrites model text,
 * and never reorders anything.
 *
 * Nothing is remembered between calls, so the session runner is the single owner of DCP state and
 * lifecycle: it loads history, declares the envelope it is about to send, calls `reduce`, lowers
 * the result and builds the request. A turn cannot inherit a stale projection, a restart cannot
 * lose one, and no consumer can disagree with the runtime about what was sent — the runner
 * publishes the returned report and clients render it instead of deriving their own.
 *
 * ## Determinism
 *
 * Every rung is a function of the messages alone, and each one is monotonic: a call that is
 * superseded, an input that has gone stale, a message that was dropped, stays that way as the
 * session grows. The request prefix therefore only changes where something genuinely new happened,
 * which keeps provider prompt caching useful.

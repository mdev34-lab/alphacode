 *   and every in-flight call is rejected. Nothing is replayed: a call that
 *   was in flight during a crash has unknown effects, so the higher level
 *   must decide whether and how to retry.
 * - `onclose` therefore means "this transport died", not "the worker is
 *   gone for good" — a replacement follows automatically for crashes
 *   (bounded by `maxRestarts`), and `onRestart` re-establishes parent-side
 *   state (e.g. re-issuing the server listen) on the new process.
 * - Only crash-classified exits restart (see `isWorkerCrash`). Clean exits,
 *   shutdowns, and plain `exit code 1` terminate via `closed` instead.

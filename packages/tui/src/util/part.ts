// wholesale would erase rendered text, so streamed content is preserved.
//
// The protocol gives us causality without a version number
// (`packages/opencode/src/session/processor.ts`):
// - `message.part.delta` text evolves only by append (`text-delta`,
//   `reasoning-delta`), so a snapshot that is a strict prefix of what is
//   already rendered is necessarily older — keep the longer streamed text;
// - a snapshot that extends the rendered text accumulated more deltas — adopt;
// - the only legitimate non-cumulative text write is the `text-end` snapshot
//   (the `experimental.text.complete` plugin rewrites the final text) and it
//   is published together with `time.end`; that snapshot is adopted;
// - a part reaches its terminal snapshot exactly once, so once `time.end` is
//   set the part is a sink: a replayed row without `time.end` — even one that
//   "extends" the final text — is older and must not reopen the part, and a
//   second terminal row with different text cannot be causally newer either;
// - any other conflict (same length, different content; reordered rows) has no
//   causal ordering, so never replace text already on screen.

// - a stale replay of an earlier status never rewinds the state;
// - `output` / `error` are written once, by that single terminal transition;
// - a second snapshot of the same status cannot carry newer `output`/`error`

// Curated editorial overview of the most useful slash commands shown in the
// /help dialog.
//
// This is intentionally NOT a complete command reference: the command palette
// (and the per-context command registrations it reads) is the authoritative,
// complete list. Keep this concise and stable rather than trying to mirror
// every registered command. Keeping this data import-free lets it be unit
// tested without pulling in the Solid/OpenTUI renderer stack.
